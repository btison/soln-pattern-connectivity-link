[#in_depth]
== An in-depth look at the solution's architecture

As Globex gears to support access to their core services from other applications, they adopt a Kubernetes native approach to application connectivity through Red Hat Connectivity Link. 

In this solution we will look at a step-by-step approach to onboarding a new application and allowing for accessing the Globex services in a secure fashion

This pattern aims to cover the following use cases of Connectivity Link

* *Connect*: Setup app connectivity across service endpoints
* *Secure*: Secure traffic with automatic ACME-based TLS integration
* *Protect*: AuthPolicy and RateLimitPolicy help to protect services with our flexible and powerful policies
